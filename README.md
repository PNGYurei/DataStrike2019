Program Flow:
GUI_main.py is initializing a GAME object.
The GAME object will:

    -add all objects to a list of game objects
    -create two players

Every turn:
    -Call code on each itrm of object array

Classes:
    -GameObject
        -Unit
        -Resource
    -Player
    -Game
    -Map

TESTING:
    -main.py is used right now for testing without the GUI

TODO:
    -Comment methods
    -Reorganize object creation (get all objects created properly)
